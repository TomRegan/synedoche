BUGS:
  Please send bug reports to <bugs.tregan@gmail.com>

  If you're able, please:
    1. Check the bugs on <> (sorry pre-release, try the todo list!)
       and see if your bug is already listed, if it is just submit
       a `me too'.
    2. Download the most recent version from the repo (you can check
       the version number in module/lib/Header.py) and verify your
       bug still isn't fixed.
    3. Enter a new bug (pre-release).
    4. E-mail me at bugs.tregan@gmail.com

  Reporting a Bug:
    Bug reports are most helpful when they provide good information.
    The following guidelines explain how to write a useful bug report.
    1. Steps to Reproduce:
       Write down the steps an idiot would need to take so that they'd
       get this problem. Try to be precise and include any error
       messages or other detail you see.
       Bad  : "It doesn't work."
       Good : "Running the Cli from a Bash prompt causes a crash and
               gives the error `fatal: cannot read configuration'"
    2. Give a Summary:
       If you can describe the problem in about 10 words, this will
       help categorize and triage the bug.
       Bad  : "Command Line Client doesn't work properly."
       Good : "Hitting ^C in the Cli doesn't stop the simulation."
    3. Specific Types of Bug:
       If you have some special information about the bug, for
       example you saw the stack trace of an unhandled exception,
       please include it, but please don't guess.
    4. Go Back and Simplify Everything!
       "The reports of unhandled exceptions are greatly exaggerated."
       By all means attach a stack trace; if you ran the program on
       Valgrind that's brilliant, but please only report reliable
       information. Jargon and sleuthing are not often helpful.

    Thanks very much for helping. If you'd like a credit, say so in
    an email to <code.tregan@gmail.com>.
