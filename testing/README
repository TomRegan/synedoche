### Usage ###
Make sure the root system directory is on PYTHONPATH. In existing
tests this is achieved by appending the parent directory using
sys.path.

### Notes ###
Test coverage is currently focussed on the Processor and Memory
files because they contain the most frequent cause of errors.
Coverage will be improved to include Interpreter at a later
date.

In-file unit testing exists for some early files but is no longer
maintained.
